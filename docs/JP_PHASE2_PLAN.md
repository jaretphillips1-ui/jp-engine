# JP Engine — Phase 2 Plan (Calm Expansion)

Status: Active
Last updated: 2026-02-20 12:54:37

## Phase 2 Operating Rule (Expansion Filter)
We prioritize capability progress over infrastructure polish.

Before any change, classify it:
- **🟢 Expansion:** directly adds capability / progress → do now
- **🟡 Optional:** nice-to-have, not blocking → consider later
- **🔴 Tooling gravity:** polish/guardrails “just in case” → backlog unless fixing current friction

Default answer: **move forward**, not “improve tooling”.

## Current Baseline (confirmed)
- Clean repo + verified toolchain
- One-button: health + save proof + commit helper
- Guidebook + AI reminders in place
- Travel mode documented
- Clean handoff structure proven (SaveProof + handoff snapshot)

## Phase 2 Goals (3–5)
1. Use JP Engine to produce real workflow outcomes (less patching, more progress).
2. Expand surface area (cross-project consistency + daily workflows) before any deep hardening.
3. Keep travel readiness practical (GitHub-first, low local dependence).
4. Maintain “green by default” with minimal, high-leverage changes.

## Lane Choices (pick ONE at a time)
- **Lane A — Workflow Expansion:** JP Engine becomes a daily command center (start → work → commit → publish → save).
- **Lane B — Cross-Project Standardization:** bring EFSP + FGS up to the same Guidebook/Reminders/Start-Save-Shutdown structure.
- **Lane C — Travel Readiness:** prove end-to-end work from remote contexts; remove friction points.

## Definition of Done (Phase 2)
Phase 2 is complete when:
- We’ve delivered at least **one** concrete expansion outcome (Lane A/B/C) with repeatable steps.
- Tooling changes happen only to remove real friction (not “just in case”).
- Start/Resume → Work → Save/Shutdown feels calm and reliable.

## Backlog (Tooling Gravity Parking Lot)
(Only add items here if they come up during real work.)
- TBD
