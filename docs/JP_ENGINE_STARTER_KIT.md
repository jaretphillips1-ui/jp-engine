# JP Engine Starter Kit (Lean Pro Baseline)

## Install immediately (free, high ROI)
1) **Branch protection rules** (GitHub UI)
   - Require PR review
   - Require CI checks to pass
   - Block direct pushes to main
2) **Conventional Commits** (commit format discipline)
3) **Gitleaks** (secret scanning in CI)
4) **PSScriptAnalyzer** (PowerShell linting in CI)
5) **Minimal CI pipeline** (runs on every PR/push)

## Not yet (avoid early drag)
- semantic-release
- heavy pre-commit ecosystems
- paid analyzers / enterprise platforms

## Why this starter kit
High signal, low maintenance, prevents the most common failure modes without slowing development.
